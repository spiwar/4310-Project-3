# BUAN 4310 Project 3: Predicting home prices in King County

## Problem 3 Introduction:
On one Earth in the multiverse of madness: With escalating home prices in King County, Jacob Kawalski decided to 
launch a real estate business. However, he needs to understand the real estate market.

## Objectives:
Regarding this problem, we will analyze a sample from the larger dataset 'kc_house_data_2.csv'. Based on the sample, 
we will build and select an appropriate model for the business, predicting the home prices in King County.

## Data Description:
The house_2.csv dataset represents ten of thousands information from customers, which includes many variables,
like year, prices, number of bathroom, number of bedrooms, zipcode, square feet, etc.
